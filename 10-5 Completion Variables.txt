Completion Variables

	completion variables is an easy way to synchronize between two tasks in the kernel when one task needs to signal to the other that an event occurred

	completion variables merely provide a simple solution to a problem whose answer is otherwise semaphores

	completion variables are represented by struct completion type defined in <linux/competion.h>

	statically created completion variable is created and initialized via
		DECLARE_COMPLETION(mr_comp);

	dynamically created completion is initialized via
		init_completion()

	wait_for_completion(): waits for the given completion variable to be signaled

	complete(): signals any waiting tasks to wake up
