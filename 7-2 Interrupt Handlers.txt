Interrupt Handlers

	interrupt handler(Interrupt Service Routine) - function the kernel runs in response to a specific interrupt

	each device that generates interrupts has an associated interrupt handler

	in Linux, interrupt handlers are normal C functions

	what differentiates interrupt handler from other kernel functions is that the kernel invokes them in response to interrupts and that they run in a special context called interrupt context(atomic context)

	interrupt handler can be executed at any time

	it is important to the hardware that the PS services the interrupt without delay

	it is also important to the rest of the system that the interrupt handler executes as short as possible

	interrupt handler's job is to acknowledge the interrupt's receipt to hardware

	interrupt handler have a large amount of work to perform

Top Halves Versus Bottom Halves

	two goals	- execute quickly
				- perform a large amount of work

	because of these competing goals, the processing of interrupts is split into two parts

	top half - run immediately upon receipt of the interrupt and performs only the work that is time-critical

	bottom half - runs in the future, at a more convenient time, with all interrupts enabled
