System Calls

Communicating with the Kernel

	System call - layer between the hardware and user-space processes

	purpose of system call
		1. provides an abstracted hardware interface for userspace

		2. ensure system security and stability

		3. allows for the virtualized system provided to processes

	In Linux, system calls are the only means user-space has of interfacing with the kernel

APIs, POSIX, and the C Library

	 API(Application Programming Interface)	- defines a set of programming interfaces used by applications
	 										- can be implemented as a system call

	 POSIX	- one of the common application programming interfaces in the UNIX world
	 		- excellent example of the relationship between APIs and system calls

	 system call interface in Linux is provided in part by the C library

	 C library implements the main API, including the standard C library and the system call interface

	 it is important for the kernel to keep track of the potential uses of a system call and keep the system call as general as possible
