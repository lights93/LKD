The Linux Implementation of Threads

	Linux implements all threads as standard process
	a thread is merely a process that shares certain resources with other processes.

	TO other OS : threads are an abstraction to provide lighter, quicker execution unit than the heavy process

	TO linux : threads are simply a manner of sharing resources between processes

Creating Threads

	Threads are created the same as normal tasks, with the exception that the clone() is passed flags corresponding to the specific resources to be shared

	Thread - clone(CLONE_VM | CLONE_FS | CLONE_FILES | CLONE_SIGHAND, 0)

	fork() - clone(SIGCHLD, 0)

	vfork() - clone(CLONE_VFORK | CLONE_VM | SIGCHLD, 0)

Kernel Threads

	The kernel accomplishes perform some operations in the background via kernel threads

	kernel threads do not have an address space(mm pointer is NULL)

	they operate only in kernel-space and do not context switch into user-space

	kernel thread can be created only by another kernel thread

	kernel thread can be created and made runnable with kthread_run()

	kthread_run() - kthread_create() + wake_up_process()
